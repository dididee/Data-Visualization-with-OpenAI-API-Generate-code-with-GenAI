1.
Question 1
In the OpenAI API, what is the purpose of "content" in a prompt?

1 point

It specifies the programming language to be used


It defines the specific task to be performed by the API


It represents the user's role in the data analysis process


It is not used in API requests

2.
Question 2
What is the purpose of the .env file in the context of setting up the OpenAI API?

1 point

It is used to import Python modules into Colab.


It contains Python code for data analysis.


It stores the OpenAI API key.


It is a data visualization tool.

3.
Question 3

What's the primary purpose of providing context and data in a chat-based prompt when using the OpenAI API?

1 point

To confuse the model


To improve response relevance and accuracy


To make the model more creative


To limit the length of responses

Question 6

What is the purpose of the exec method in Python?

1 point

To execute an external command or script.


To evaluate a Python expression and return the result.


To execute a block of a generated Python code stored as a string.


To execute a system-level function from a Python module.

7.
Question 7

What is the purpose of adding the globals() function to the exec method in Python code?

1 point

It restricts the execution of code to the local scope.


It allows for the creation of new local and global variables.


It specifies the maximum number of tokens for code execution.


It provides access to the executed code to be globally used.

8.
Question 8
What is the purpose of the response variable in the following Python code?

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(

model='gpt-4',

messages=[system, user],

max_tokens=1200

)

1 point

It stores the user's input for further processing.


It stores the system's instructions for the AI model.


It stores the generated response from the AI model.


It sets the maximum number of tokens the AI model can use.

9.
Question 9
What is considered the best practice for prompting the OpenAI API to obtain effective responses?  

1 point

Use specific and technical jargon in the prompt.


Define the steps clearly in direct language.


Provide a lengthy and detailed prompt.


Repeat the same prompt multiple times.
